## Cyber-physical systems programming course's project

This repository will be useful to save our acknowledgments and progresses related to the project.
The main goal of it is the following: in a Gazebo environment we will need to create two drone instancies, one equipped with a camera and the other "blind"; the first drone will be working with a neural network, called DeepPilot, able to generate the commands for its motors and movements. Using MicroXRCE DDS we will send the right commands to the second drone in order for it to follow the first one. The use of PX4 and ROS2 as middleware will be mandatory.
