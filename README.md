## Cyber-physical systems programming course's project

This repository will be useful to save our acknowledgments and progresses related to the project.
The main goal of it is the following: in a Gazebo environment we will need to create the instance of one drone, equipped with the required sensors, like a depth camera, in order to build a 3D map of the simulated environment and localize the position of the drone itself (SLAM algorithm = Simultaneous Localization and Mapping). The tools we will employ are ROS 2 and PX4 Autopilot.
