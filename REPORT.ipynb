With two drones, both will have odometries equal to 0 0 0 if they don't move, so if we publish the transform map->base_link_1 and map->base_link_2 using the odometry the frames of the two drones will overlap. We tried using other topics like *local_position* but the result is the same.

    "The simulation carried out in Gazebo returned initially an unstable vertical position and acceleration, leading to various problems when trying to control the drones in offboard mode: when the system doesn't have a stable height estimation it doesn't allow to arm the drone and navigate. To reduce this observed oscillation we worked on the .sdf.jinja file responsible for generating the drones: in particular we increased the inertia of the components, added a small value of dampening to prevent vibrations and finally reduced the noise of both the accelerometer and gyroscope, almost completely nulling the vertical bouncing the drones had; in addition, when the registered position of the drones indicates a point below ground, the position is overwritten with a 0 value, just to clean the Rviz visualization."
