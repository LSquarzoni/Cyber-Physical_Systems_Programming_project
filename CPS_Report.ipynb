With two drones, both will have odometries equal to 0 0 0 if they don't move, so if we publish the transform map->base_link_1 and map->base_link_2 using the odometry the frames of the two drones will overlap. We tried using other topics like *local_position* but the result is the same. So we need the absolute position of the drones with respect to the world."
